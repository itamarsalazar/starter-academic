Currently working at the Medical Image Laboratory (\href{https://investigacion.pucp.edu.pe/laboratorio/imagenes-medicas/}{LIM} ) from PUCP exploring robust methods for ultrasound image formation with deep learning. Former researcher in the group of Signal Processing and Artificial Intelligence at [INICTEL-UNI](https://www.inictel-uni.edu.pe/index.php/2020/03/04/procesamiento-de-senales-imagenes-e-inteligencia-artificial/) where we applied machine learning and signal & image processing techniques in agricultural and biomedical projects. Former intern in the Signal Processing Laboratory [LTS4](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/) at EPFL tudying the inductive bias of deep neural networks (DNN) using concepts from signals and systems. I have teaching experience in signal processing and AI-related courses. During my master, I studied the inverse problem for electroencephalographic signals and for my undergrad thesis I explored machine learning algorithms to automatically detect diseased areas on plant leaves.

My current interest are the application of DNN for ultrasound image formation and the study of its robustness.
