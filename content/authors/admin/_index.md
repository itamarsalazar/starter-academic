I am a researcher in the Group of Artificial Intelligence and Signal & Image Processing at INICTEL-UNI in Lima, Perú. I am currently doing an internship at [LTS4 Lab in EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/) working on the inductive bias of Deep Neural Networks. <br>
In my undergraduate thesis I studied algorithms to automatically detect ill areas over leaf digital images, this study allowed me to have a better
understanding of some machine learning techniques (SVM, ANN, KNN, among others) and to have a better sense about the difficulty of vision
tasks. After that I attended some short courses about neuroscience and I have become interested in the field and in the brain. I made a master in
which I explored some techniques to solve the EEG inverse problem (MNE, WMNE, FOCUSS, MFOCUSS and Multiple Sparse Priors), I manipulated
EEG recordings taken during attention tasks (P300 waves) using SPM software. During the last year I have been using CNNs in different problems
like image or video classifications. I observed that current AI techniques have some problems manipulating ”the unknown” in classification tasks
(a.k.a openset problem) and that are vulnerable to small changes (adversarial examples). I am interested on those problems.
